        <h1>Healthcare infrastructure in Australia</h1>
        <p>Australia's healthcare system faces a number of challenges, particularly in ensuring equal access to services across regions. 
          The distribution of hospitals and their capacities vary widely, with urban areas generally having better resources than rural regions. 
          Healthcare funding also differs across states, reflecting population needs and local healthcare policies.</p>

        <h2>Private and Public Hospital in Australia</h2>
          <p>Public hospitals are generally government-funded and provide services to all Australians, 
            often focusing on emergency and specialized care. Private hospitals, while offering more flexibility 
            and shorter wait times, usually operate on a fee-for-service basis, with many patients relying on private health insurance.
            Accessibility to healthcare varies significantly across different regions, with metropolitan areas typically having better 
            coverage and larger hospital capacities compared to rural and remote regions.</p>

        <h2>What makes up hospital expenditure</h2>
          <p>
            In Australia, healthcare funding is shared between federal and state governments, with each state managing its own public
             hospital system. The expenditure on healthcare can vary significantly depending on population size, healthcare demands, 
             and regional challenges. <br><br><br> States like New South Wales and Victoria tend to have higher healthcare spending due to their 
             larger populations and higher hospital usage rates. This visual highlights how different states allocate their budgets
             towards hospital services, which is a key indicator of healthcare priorities and the capacity to serve the public.</p>

        <h2>Hospital performance</h2>
          <p>
            Long waiting times in emergency departments are often an indicator of strain on healthcare resources. High demand, combined with 
            limited capacity, can lead to patients experiencing significant delays before receiving medical attention, particularly in 
            high-pressure urban centers.<br><br>
            The 90th percentile waiting time represents the longest delays faced by 10% of patients, a critical metric that reflects how well 
            or poorly a system handles peak loads. Long 90th percentile wait times can indicate bottlenecks in the system, which may result from 
            understaffing, insufficient resources, or inefficiencies in patient processing.<br><br>
            On the other hand, the median waiting time is a measure of typical service performance, showing the experience of an average patient. 
            States with lower median waiting times tend to have more efficient emergency services, suggesting better management of day-to-day patient flow.

        <p>
          In Australia, emergency departments are a crucial component of the healthcare system, providing care for urgent and life-threatening conditions.
          Over the years, the number of presentations to EDs has been steadily increasing across most states, driven by factors such as population growth, 
          aging demographics, and the rising prevalence of chronic conditions.<br>
          Larger states like New South Wales and Victoria consistently report higher numbers of emergency visits, reflecting their larger populations and 
          more extensive healthcare needs. On the other hand, smaller states and territories, such as Tasmania and the Northern Territory, see fewer 
          presentations, but may still face challenges in meeting the demand for urgent care with limited resources.
