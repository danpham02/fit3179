        <h1>Healthcare infrastructure in Australia</h1>
        <p>Australia's healthcare system faces a number of challenges, particularly in ensuring equal access to services across regions. 
          The distribution of hospitals and their capacities vary widely, with urban areas generally having better resources than rural regions. 
          Healthcare funding also differs across states, reflecting population needs and local healthcare policies.</p>

        <h2>Private and Public Hospital in Australia</h2>
          <p>Public hospitals are generally government-funded and provide services to all Australians, 
            often focusing on emergency and specialized care. Private hospitals, while offering more flexibility 
            and shorter wait times, usually operate on a fee-for-service basis, with many patients relying on private health insurance.
            Accessibility to healthcare varies significantly across different regions, with metropolitan areas typically having better 
            coverage and larger hospital capacities compared to rural and remote regions.</p>

        <h2>What makes up hospital expenditure</h2>
          <p>
            In Australia, healthcare funding is shared between federal and state governments, with each state managing its own public
             hospital system. The expenditure on healthcare can vary significantly depending on population size, healthcare demands, 
             and regional challenges</p>

        <h2>Hospital performance</h2>
          <p>
            Emergency waiting times are an important measure of a healthcare system's efficiency and its ability to provide timely care. 
            In emergency departments, long waiting times can result in delayed care, which can impact patient outcomes. 
            The 90th percentile waiting time is used to represent the longest waiting times experienced by 10% of patients</p>
